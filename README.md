## Goals

1. Git Collaboration

2. Team Building

3. Personal & Portfolio Development 

4. Coding Skill Strengthening 


## Rules:

1. Fork & Checkout Branch - **DO NOT** work on **Master** branch

    ⋅⋅⋅ Make a local copy if needed

2. Piecemeal Coding - Work on one thing at a time

3. Commits - Make them often, but reasonably

4. Comments - They help us understand what your code is doing

5. Pull Requests - Review & comment, it’s part of the collaboration!

6. Play Nice & Ask Questions!
