# Firebase

Data to be hosted for page.

First Meeting: 1/13/19
>So on the Firebase Team what we discussed the final structure of the `developer object`. We’ll be working on different `object` models to better create, retrieve and use the data. For now, we’ll create one or two of these `objects` with dummy data just to supply it to any of the other features that need info to draw from. In future meetings, if anyone has any suggestion of the `object model` or of any extra info they think should be useful to display or would look nice, we’ll add it.

>About Firebase I believe we know about the functions we’ll be using to C & R, since it’s all we’ll be doing for now. Also discussed about where to host the developer’s images, so we can store the links and our fellow front-end developers can use those to display these images on our UI. (edited)
